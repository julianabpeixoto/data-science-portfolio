## Introduction

As a passionate data science student, I constantly explore new datasets and apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems. This repository compiles my projects, each one a reflection of my growth and unwavering dedication to the field. These projects, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to building machine learning models and creating visualizations, showcase my progression and commitment.

My passion for data science stems from a deep commitment to uncovering insights hidden within data and using these findings to make impactful decisions. I am dedicated to leveraging data to drive positive change.

## Projects

### Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of Online Sales
**Description**: A hands-on exploration of real-world online sales data. It offers a unique opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. The Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist comprises nine .csv datasets and contains factual and anonymized information about 100,000 orders between 2016 and 2018 in various Brazilian marketplaces through the Olist Store.
- **Technologies**: Python, Numpy, Pandas
- **File**: [Detailed Project](https://github.com/julianabpeixoto/neurons-frying/blob/main/01.SC2023_Module2/README.md)

### Project 2: US School Shootings Analysis
**Description**: This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis on a dataset using Python and PostgreSQL. The dataset used is the US School Shootings (1970-2022) available on Kaggle. The project includes data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and answering specific questions through SQL queries.
- **Technologies**: Python, PostgreSQL, Pandas
- **File**: [Detailed Project](https://github.com/julianabpeixoto/neurons-frying/blob/main/santander_coders_2023_2semestre_trilha_data_science_banco_dados_projeto_final/README.md)

### Project 3: Statistical Analysis of School Shootings in the US concerning City Population
**Description**: This project analyzes the frequency of school shootings in the US relative to city population sizes from 1970 to 2022. I chose to continue with the analysis initiated in Project 1 to deepen my learning and analysis. By using Python and data visualization libraries, the goal is to uncover patterns that can inform public policies and preventive measures.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- **File**: [Detailed Project](https://github.com/julianabpeixoto/neurons-frying/blob/main/03.SC2023_Module4/README.md)

### Project 4: Predicting Firearm Brands: A Machine Learning Approach to Enhance Police Intelligence and Cataloging
**Description**: This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of firearm seizures. Using Python and relevant libraries, the goal is to develop a machine-learning model to classify unidentified firearm brands in a dataset where brands are labeled as 'Not Identified.' The model could assist in more efficient research and cataloging processes. This project marks the first time I learned and created a machine-learning model, making it a significant milestone in my data science journey.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **File**: [Detailed Project](https://github.com/julianabpeixoto/neurons-frying/blob/main/04.SC2023_Module5/README.md)

### Project 5: Mental Health Treatment Analysis: Enhancing Understanding through Machine Learning
**Description**: This project focuses on developing and evaluating supervised and unsupervised machine learning models for analyzing mental health treatment data, optimizing their hyperparameters, and comparing their performances.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **File**: [Detailed Project](https://github.com/julianabpeixoto/neurons-frying/blob/main/05.SC2023_Module6/README.md)
- **Feature Importance Plot for XGBoost after hyperparameters optimization**:

- **Impact Statement**: The developed models could aid mental health professionals in identifying at-risk individuals by accurately predicting which individuals are likely to seek treatment based on demographic and behavioral data. This predictive capability enables more targeted interventions and resource allocation, improving treatment outcomes and overall mental health support systems. The project also underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in public health policy and mental health care strategies.
