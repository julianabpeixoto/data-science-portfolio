## Introduction

As a passionate new data science student, I constantly explore new datasets and apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems. This repository compiles my projects, highlighting different aspects of my learning and skills and their practical applications. These projects reflect my growth and dedication to the field, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to building machine learning models and creating visualizations.

## Projects

### Project 1: US School Shootings Analysis

**Description**: This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis on a dataset using Python and PostgreSQL. The dataset used is the US School Shootings (1970-2022) available on Kaggle. The project includes data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and answering specific questions through SQL queries.
- **Technologies**: Python, PostgreSQL, Pandas

### # Statistical Analysis of School Shootings in the US concerning City Population

**Description**: This project analyzes the frequency of school shootings in the US relative to city population sizes from 1970 to 2022. I chose to continue with the analysis initiated in Project 1 to deepen my learning and analysis. By using Python and data visualization libraries, the goal is to uncover patterns that can inform public policies and preventive measures.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
