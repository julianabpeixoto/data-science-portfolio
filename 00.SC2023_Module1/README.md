## Project Overview
The final project of Module 1: Programming Logic II (Python) of 'Santander Coders 2023 | 2nd Semester—DS (3)', taught by Mauricio Sobrinho, involves recreating the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify a specific dataset. The implementation is done from scratch without using advanced libraries like Pandas, Numpy, or Scikit-Learn. Five students (Anderson Miranda, André Kuster, Artur Stein, João Souza, and I) collaborated to choose the dataset and develop the project.

## Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the KNN algorithm by implementing it from scratch and applying it to a real-world dataset to evaluate its performance.

Moreover, access to potable water is essential for health and is a fundamental human right. Water supply and sanitation investments can yield significant economic benefits by reducing adverse health effects and healthcare costs. Utilizing machine learning techniques to predict water potability can contribute to public health.

## Objectives

### General Objective
Recreate the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in Python to calculate and classify a specific dataset.

### Specific Objectives
- Implement core functions for data handling and manipulation.
- Implement distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances.
- Implement the KNN algorithm for classification.
- Evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm using various metrics.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Water Potability Dataset from Kaggle. It includes the following features:
- **pH value:** pH of water (0 to 14)
- **Hardness:** Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L
- **Solids:** Total dissolved solids in ppm
- **Chloramines:** Amount of chloramines in ppm
- **Sulfate:** Amount of dissolved sulfates in mg/L
- **Conductivity:** Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm
- **Organic_carbon:** Amount of organic carbon in ppm
- **Trihalomethanes:** Amount of trihalomethanes in μg/L
- **Turbidity:** Measure of light-emitting property of water in NTU
- **Potability:** Indicates if water is safe for human consumption (1: Potable, 0: Not Potable)

## Tasks Completed
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Implementation of core functions for data manipulation.
- Implementation of distance metrics.
- Implementation of the KNN algorithm.
- Evaluation of the KNN algorithm using different K and distance metrics values.
- Comparison with Scikit-Learn's KNN implementation.
